    # LOCKSS for computed results: move what the coordinator has learned out
    # of Postgres and into plaintext files under data/, where git and (for
    # the big pieces) S3 keep copies. The database is scheduling state — if
    # it dies we lose in-flight leases and nothing else, because the archive
    # is reconstructible without it and it is reconstructible from the
    # archive.
    #
    # Idempotent by comparison rather than bookkeeping: it asks "what does
    # the coordinator know that data/ doesn't?" every run, so a lost flag
    # can never cause a silent gap.
